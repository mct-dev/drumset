# Javascript Drumset

Use your keyboard to make drumset noises!

## **Install**

* `git clone`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## **Notes**

Designed using `parcel-bundler` for development purposes, so that's what `npm start` runs, but can also simply be run by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.
